# File Sorting by Year :books:

This script sorts files in a directory based on their type. It creates subdirectories for each file type (images, music, documents, videos) and moves corresponding files into the appropriate directory.

## Usage

1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the 'sort_files_by_type.py' script file.

2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script file.

3. Run the script by typing 'python sort_files_by_type.py'.

4. Follow the instructions to enter the path of the directory to be sorted.

5. Wait for the script to sort the files in the specified directory.


## Configuration

The script is configurable by modifying the 'file_types' dictionary in the 'sort_files_by_type.py' file. You can add or remove file types and corresponding extensions.

## Warning
This script moves files into the specified directory and may result in data loss if files are sorted incorrectly. Use it with caution and make sure to backup your important files before using it.
